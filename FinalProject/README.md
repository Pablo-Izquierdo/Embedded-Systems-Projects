# Embedded-Systems-Final-Project
This project consisted of creating a video game using the FPGA. Due to hardware and time limitations, the game would be a classic game that we prefer. We opted for Pac-Man making use of the buttons as controls, the counter as a point counter and leeds simulating live ghosts.
